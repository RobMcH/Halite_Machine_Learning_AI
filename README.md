# Machine Learning Bot for the Halite III AI competition
This repository contains a machine learning bot for the Halite III AI competition [Halite.io](https://halite.io/) based on the [ML starter bot](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III/tree/master/starter_kits/ml/SVM). It is based on Keras and TensorFlow. The repository also contains training data consisting of replays of the best bots that participated in the competition.

# Running and Training the Bot
The bot is run locally by executing the scripts run_game.bat (Windows) and run_game.sh (MacOS, Linux). For training the bot just run 'python3 ML_Bot.py', it will use all data contained in the '/train' folder.

# Differences to the ML Starter Bot
The code for the ML starter bot on GitHub is broken in several ways and not working (at all). If you want to develop your own machine learning bot, you can this repository as a basis since I already fixed all the issues.
